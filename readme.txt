== Description ==

Similliar to the category block, but list subcategories from a selected parent category instead.

The subcategory block is meant to be used within the query block to list terms that assigned to the_post that is under a selected parent term.
It can also be used within a page but outside of the query loop, and it will list all the terms within post category.
